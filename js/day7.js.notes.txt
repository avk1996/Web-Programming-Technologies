writing a web service or writing api 

React JS:

components:
Functional and class components types

parent to child and child to parent is class component

Routing

Axios 

Redux (store store at a centralized base and use it whenwhere we want) 

thunk

React (Group of compoenets which form a js and will be shown in browser)
 Vs Angular

Defn: It is a front end library, it uses MVC AND MVVM model, it helps to design SPA, and divided into multiple components, routing feature will make your SPA looks like a MPA.

-------------------------------------------------------------
To reach js we need to use CLI tool -> Create-react-app

Step 1: Create-react-app tool -> npm install Create-react-app -g
Step 2: Create a application -> create-react-app myapp

SPA: Single Page Application

To create a new application without
npx Create-react-app myapp
-------------------------------------------------------------
when we use routing it looks like MPA (multi page application)

but every react and angular are SPA

only one html page is there and when loading only portion of the page is loaded

____________________________________________
		header
		Title

Form	Table	list

footer(menu1->form,menu2->table,menu3->list)
____________________________________________

First component -> root component (app)             Level 0
And other components
Header	NavBar	Footer	Table	List		    Level 1	
			Form			    Level 2

	
While designing react applicaito, it is divided into multiple compoenets

Stateless Component			StateFull component
(Functional)				(class)
					import React,{Component} from 'React'
Every user defined component		class MyCompnent extends React.Component{
must start with capital letter		render(){
const MyComponent=()=>{			return(<h1>hello world!</h1>)
return (<h1>hello world!</h1>)		}
export default MyComponent;	

jsx 					export default MyComponent
Functial component is a 		Class component 
js function which returns
JSX Xml

It is a stateless component		it is a statful compnent, to manage internal 
because built in state 			state, we can use state building object in this 
object is not available			component

Lifecycle methods cannot be used	Lifecycle methods can be used in class component	
in functional component, but in 
new version  lot of hooks are 
available, which are equivalent to 
lifecycle methods


any object/variable in jsx must be written in curly bracket	

sending data from parent to child by props object
